**`Cover ðŸ‘»`** (codename **`C0VR`**) is a **free** and **open-source** multi-purpose discord bot, that uses [lift](https://github.com/devliftz/lift.py) by DevLift Studios and Moderators, created for fun.

### Features

  Custom command modes:
  - `0`: Only mods can add **and** manage custom commands
  - `1`: Member can add custom command but can only manage their own command

- Fun commands: games, meme and other fun stuff.
- Powerful moderation command.
- Image manipulation/filters.
- Useful utility command such as `execute` (execute python/other programming language code), `google`, `calc` / `math`, and more!

## Usage

### Quick Setup (Hosted)

Invite the officially hosted bot from this [invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1096484859477754008&permissions=8&scope=bot).

For information on how to use the bot, see https://bot.palembani.xyz/docs

### Self-Hosting

> **Note**
>
> If you're planning to self-host the bot, I'll assume you already have a
> decent knowledge of Python, discord.py and hosting bot in general. I will
> **NOT** give support for basic issue such as "Where do I get bot token", "How
> to install Python", etc.
>
> Hosting from free hosting such as Heroku is not supported either! It's
> recommended to get a proper VPS/Cloud Server to host a bot.

#### Manual

> **Warning**
>
> Python 3.10+ (3.10.9 is recommended) is required to host this bot!
